So first what we're gonna do is actually go into our django templates directory and we're gonna give django another area to look for templates so in here we're just gonna create another list item and give django another option to find our templates so we're gonna do s dot path join and this is gonna be base directory and i'm assuming you already know django and react at this point this is just the integration so i won't go into too much detail and what this is but we're gonna do base dirt and then our react app is called simply as a string react app ford. So what we're gonna do is actually just drag the react app into the jingle root directory so if i open up my project here we're gonna see the react app appear within it so that's the to-do app and just give it a second to move that in and what we're gonna have to do is actually go ahead and cd again into that react app and now within the django project. So there's just gonna be a better idea of how all this works in just a little bit more advanced so for now what we're gonna do is just run this npx create react app command and we're gonna set this up on our desktop and then drag this into a django project that we built here so i just ran django - admin start project and that's it. But i'm choosing just a simple version because this is just an integration video so we're just rying to get it set up and started so we'll just go ahead and call it react app let's just try that see if it lets us do that and give it a minute it's gonna run some installs and once this is done i'll probably just fast forward this. So now we're gonna do desktop to do and not a zero but we even go there and then react app and then let's go ahead and just run build right now so this command and get everything prepped so npm and then run build and get everything set up for our template. So django will handle everything on the back end while react takes care of everything on the front end so we're just gonna build a simple hello world app and show you how that integration works right now we'll just render out a template but in another video we will actually build off of this and build a full-fledged to-do app with the rest api where we'll handle all that crud operation So if we set that up and now connect our static files so we also want to connect to static and then all those react static files we need to make one more configuration down here so down in our settings dot py file we're gonna do static files dirt so static files underscore ders and that's gonna be equal to you just to list there and here we're gonna copy instead of writing it out again just because i'm a really slow typer when i'm talking we're just gonna do this oh s dot path and paste that in and change up one little thing there so instead of react app build we're gonna do react app build and then we want to go into this file here so for slash static so now we know to get all the static files here so right now our jingle project if we open it up i believe it'll just be it'll give us an error at this point if i run my server so let's go ahead and open up our to do app and if i run the server. Slash build and that'll give us access to this folder here and indexhtml sits right here so now that we can use this template what we need to do is actually connect this into our urls that py file so within our root directory in our django project first we're gonna run an import and we just want to use class-based view here that just allows us to render a template without actually calling a view so we're gonna import from django views dot generic import and then we're gonna do template view so template view capital v there and we're just gonna create the path and what we're gonna do is allow the base url to be our jingle app. So if i save this and i actually need to also update my app to a css file within react and i'll just go ahead and remove all of this and paste that in so you can copy this from my source code or just write that out it's not too much so if i refresh my jingle app it's not gonna work i'm assuming you know this if you know react we just have to run build again so in pm run build and if i refresh this in a second we should see what i showed you in that. So what i'm gonna do now is actually just work within that react app and render out some template data but the configuration is done so every time we go into our django app or our react app. So what's happening here is because we included this path right here into our react project into this build folder right here we're able to set a file path just to render out this template so this built template every time we run that run build command. And i'm actually gonna copy and paste my own code here so give me a second i'm gonna drag this in from another project here .
